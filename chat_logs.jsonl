These platforms can be fully self-hosted, providing full ownership of data, infrastructure, and compliance posture. They support local AI (LLMs/RAG), private cloud setups, and hybrid architectures with strict compliance requirements. The backend uses Node.js and PHP/Laravel services alongside a PostgreSQL database for storage, while exposing AI logic through REST APIs for intent detection, routing, context handling, and response formatting. Future integrations like wearables and real-time systems are also supported. For edge AI deployments, the architecture focuses on localized inference, structured incident data management, and human-in-the-loop review to enhance precision and recall.", "latency_ms": 3567.07}
